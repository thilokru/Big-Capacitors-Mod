A distillery is used to
purify solutions. It uses
the fact, that different
substances evaporate at
different temperatures.
For example, distilled
Water is created by heat-
ing Water 100 °C, so that
the Water evaporates, but
the salts stay behind.
The Water vapor is then
condensated.
The distillerys input is
on the left, the output
on the right, and the
energy is fed in from
the back.
