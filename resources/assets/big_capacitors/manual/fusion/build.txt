In order to build a tokamak,
you place a three block tall
superconducting coil in the
center and on top the fusion
reactor controller. Around
the middle coil block you
place the reactor shielding
as shown in the pictures.

The crafting recipies are
displayed on the next few
pages. In order to get the
fusion controlling processor,
you need to find villager(clerk),
who is willing to trade.
