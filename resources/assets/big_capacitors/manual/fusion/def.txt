A fusion reactor is fusing
small atoms together to
bigger atoms. A small amount
of mass is lost during this
process. Einstein's probably
most famous equation states
that an enormous amount of
energy is set free by this.

The fusion reactor you can
build here is called tokamak.
A coil produces a strong
magnetic field holding a hot
plasma in space. If the 
plasma is hot enough, fusion
starts.
