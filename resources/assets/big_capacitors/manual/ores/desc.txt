Two ores can be found in the
world. These are Witherite
Ore an Rustil Ore. Witherite
is a crystal made out of
barium carbonate (BaCO3).
Rutil on the other hand is
a crystal made out of titan
dioxyd (TiO2). Together,
they react under great heat
to barium titanate (BaTiO3),
a ceramic with awesome
dielectric properties, and
CO2. It has a dielectricity
of 1000!
