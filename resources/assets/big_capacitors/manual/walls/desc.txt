A capacitor basically is made out of 2 things. The walls and the material
between the walls. The material in between the walls is covered in the
chapter 'Dielectricity'. Capacitor Walls are made as shown on the second
page. They need to be placed facing each other. (See screenshot)


The RF energy system has two conductors. One is the energy conduit, the other
is the earth. So, one side of the capacitor needs to be grounded. Your multitool
displays whether one side is grounded or not. If it is, you can't extract energy
from this side. You can change that with your multitool, but you will lose all
energy stored.
