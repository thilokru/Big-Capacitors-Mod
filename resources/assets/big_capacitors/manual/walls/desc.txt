A capacitor basically is
made out of 2 things. The
Walls, the material be-
tween the walls and the
material between the
walls. The material in
between the walls is
covered in the chapter
'Dielectricity'.
Capacitor Walls are made
as shown on the secound
page. They need to be
placed facing each other.
