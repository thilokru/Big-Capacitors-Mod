The RF energy system has
two conductors. One is the
energy conduit, the other
is the earth. So, one side
of the capacitor needs to
be grounded. Your multitool
displays whether one side is
grounded or not. If it is,
you can't extract energy
from this side. You can
change that with your mul-
titool, but you will lose
all energy stored.
